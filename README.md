* GUI: https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl
* GBA Emulator: https://github.com/libretro/vba-next

## Feature
* The emulator kernel is based on [vba-next](https://github.com/libretro/vba-next) and does not depend on any third-party libraries.
* Decoupled from the OS, only relying on lvgl's memory allocation and file access interface.
* Support to use GBA framebuffer directly as `lv_canvas` buffer, zero copy overhead.

## To be completed
* Audio output support.
* Memory usage optimization.
